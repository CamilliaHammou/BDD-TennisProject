# BDD-TennisProject
This Kata is about a simplified tennis game like Wii Tennis. Scores: "love", "15", "30", "40". At 40, if you win the point, you win unless both are at 40 ("deuce"). From deuce: win = "advantage", win again = game. If other wins = back to deuce. First to 4 points with 2 point lead wins. The aim is to write code driven by behavioral tests.
